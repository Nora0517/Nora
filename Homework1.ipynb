    "The first use of the word “computer” was to someone who actually did calculation. We have created many types of keyboard to try to make typing more efficient. We used to have specialists to charge from abacus to mechanical calculators to do the math problem, but they are not so efficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Computer made a huge leap during World WarⅡ, when it was used in cryptography. People used punch card in 1950s and magnetic tape in 1970s and 80s to store information. But that time, computer sick a lot of space. Gradually we change the storage machine from vacuum tubes to transistors then to small computer chips, making computers more compact and more efficient. Then we invented compiler to change human language via a program into machine code. Eventually the industry gave way to the first hard disk drives and microprocessors, and computers are getting smaller and smaller. Apple made it come true to use computer in home and office, and thanks to Microsoft founded by Bill Gates, computers are more accessible to consumers. Then video games born. Stallman created OS which was open source. It set a foundation of the largest open-source operating system: Linux. In 90s, PDA allowed computing to go mobile. And then comes the mobile phone.  "

    "## What is an operating system?  \n",
    "---\n",
    "Operating system is the whole package that manages our computer’s resources and lets us interact with it. There are two main part of the operating system: the kernel and the user space. Kernel talks directly to our hardware and manages our system’s resources and we interact with user space. The mainly used operating systems are Windows, Mac and Linux. Windows by Microsoft is commonly used as the default operating system, and in today’s world, PC refers to a Windows computer. Mac by Apple is mainly used in consumer space, and is pre-loaded in an Apple computer. Linux is an open-source operating system and can be used heavily in business infrastructure and in the consumer space. Another operating system is called Chrome OS. All OS share common characteristics and we can control all OS if we understand the basic blocks of one OS. A kernel’s functions are: file storage and management, process management, memory management and I/O management. And user space is outside the kernel like text editors, music players, system settings etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For file handling, we have three parts: file data, metadata and file system. Different file system doesn’t play nice to each other. We write file data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. Block storage improves faster handling of data because the data isn’t stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker. Metadata contains the information about our file like file owner, permissions, file size and so on. A file extension is the appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For process management, a process is a program that is executing, and a program is an APP that we can run. We can have many processes of the same program running at the same time, but we have finite amount of resources. Our kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated so that all the programs we use can be run, it makes time slice. A time slice is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For memory management, running CPU also takes up space in memory. To give us more memory than we physically have, we use virtual memory. Virtual memory is a combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use. It’s usually used for large files to save space of RAM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For I/O management, I/O devises are devises that perform input and output like mouse, keyboard, speakers and so on. When the kernel is able to start the drivers to communicate with hardware, it also manages the transfer of data in and out of the devices and talk to each other. When you’re troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it’s usually sort of hardware resource deficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in the user space we can interact with our OS: shell and graphical user interface (in which we can see what we do). In the lecture we use a CLI shell: BASH. A shell is a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logs are files that record system events on our computer, just like a system’s diary. We can refer back to them when we need to find out something that happened. But logs can be hard to navigate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we start a computer, we use the term **boot**. The boot processes are: computer powered on—BIOS/UEFI initializes hardware—BIOS/UEFI runs POST(power-on self-test)—boot devices started on—find the bootloader(a small program that loads the OS)—OS loaded—kernel loaded—resources and drivers, etc. loaded(hardware talks to software)—essential system processes and user space launched.

We also use fiber-optic cables, which is the most expensive, to connect to the network. Computers connect to different devices that help organize our network together. The first is a router, which connects different devices together and helps route network traffic. Our files are traveling through routers, switches(from lots of routers) and hubs(send to everyone).

The most important of these is empathy. It is to see something in someone else’s perspective and do the action. The next is tone. Communicating with a good tone is a delicate balance. Make sure to familiarize yourself with a local style. Acknowledge the user. Say something when you are going to continue to work. And then build the trust.

To really build a rapport, try to remember a personal fact they’ve mentioned and bring it up later. Just make sure you clarify the person’s issue before you start to troubleshoot. Be aware of how you probe for information, make sure to set context and explain why you’re asking the question. The last five minutes of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction. So, make sure to end on a positive note.  \n",

The hardest and the best technique is to identify where the interaction went wrong in the moment and redirect the conversation. It’s important to try and identify why this is happening. Be patient.
